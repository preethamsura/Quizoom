however planes fly requires us to familiarize ourselves with the forces that act on them as they slice through the air there are 4 of these forces to artificial ones designed to overcome to natural one.
these natural forces are the window playing for the force of gravity and wind resistance or drag which is a form of friction exerted by different gases molecules again surmounting these effects requires forces known as lift and thrust each of which is delivered by a unique piece of technology found on any airplane first thing is to help you out and perhaps the most familiar part of the flight experience and your plane engine is an engineering Marvel only itself.
the engine that powered the famous 1903 life designed by the Wright brothers featured a custom built will force power gasoline engine.
it was a sensually powered by change that drove twin propellers.
2 days turbo jet engines are a far cry from their predecessors weighing up to 8000 pounds in generating more than 30000 horsepower both however accomplish the same job to provide a force trust your planes both on take off.
and once they're in the air.
